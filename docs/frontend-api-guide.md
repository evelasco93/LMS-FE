# Frontend Guide: LMS Campaigns, Participants, and Leads

This doc summarizes how the LMS API behaves so the frontend can model the UI. API reference source: [api/openapi.json](api/openapi.json).

> **Terminology note:** The backend API uses `affiliate`, `criteria`, `logic`, and `pixel` in endpoint paths, field names, and response bodies. The frontend displays these as **Source**, **Fields**, **Rules**, and **Webhook** respectively. This guide uses the backend terminology to match the actual API contracts.

## High-level flow

- Create client(s) and affiliate(s).
- Create a campaign (starts DRAFT).
- Link at least one client and one affiliate to the campaign. Linking an affiliate returns a `campaign_key` used for all lead submissions from that affiliate. **Linking always sets participant status to TEST.**
- Move campaign to TEST once both client and affiliate are linked. Participant status starts as TEST; change to LIVE via participant update endpoints.
- Optionally flip participant statuses (TEST ↔ LIVE or DISABLED) via participant update endpoints.
- Move campaign to ACTIVE only when campaign is currently TEST and it has at least one LIVE client and one LIVE affiliate (DISABLED participants are ignored for the LIVE requirement).
- Campaigns now include `plugins` configuration. By default, `plugins.duplicate_check.enabled=true` with criteria `phone` and `email`. `plugins.trusted_form.enabled=false` and `plugins.ipqs.enabled=false` on creation. `duplicate_check` is **always auto-enabled** when a campaign is promoted to ACTIVE — TrustedForm and IPQS are optional. Each plugin has a `stage` (integer ≥ 2) that controls execution order and a `gate` flag that controls whether a failure halts the pipeline.
- The campaign response includes `submit_url` and `submit_url_test` — display these to affiliates so they know exactly where to send leads.
- Lead submission (`POST /leads`, `POST /leads/test`) always returns `{ result: "passed" | "failed", message, ... }`. Accepted: adds `data: { lead_id, message }`. Rejected (soft): adds `lead_id` + optional `errors[]`. Pre-validation rejection: adds `error` (no lead stored). Internal lead detail is only available via `GET /leads/{id}` (internal API).
- Rotate keys if compromised: use the new key rotation endpoints to issue a fresh `campaign_key` for an affiliate or `client_key` for a linked client.
- Deletion safeguards: campaigns can only be deleted in DRAFT/TEST when empty and without leads; clients/affiliates must be disabled in all campaigns before soft delete and cannot be hard deleted when campaigns have leads.
- Internal API is protected by Bearer token auth — call `POST /v2/auth/login` to get a token, then send `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` on all internal API requests. **Use `id_token`, not `access_token`** — the API Gateway Cognito authorizer validates ID tokens.
- External lead intake is a separate API Gateway with POST-only routes. No API key required — the `campaign_id` and `campaign_key` in the request body serve as authentication.

## Entities and statuses

- Client status: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED. **Soft-deleting a client automatically sets status to INACTIVE.**
- Affiliate status: ACTIVE, INACTIVE. **Soft-deleting an affiliate automatically sets status to INACTIVE.**
- Campaign participant status: TEST, LIVE, DISABLED (per linked client/affiliate inside the campaign).
- Campaign status: DRAFT → TEST → ACTIVE.

### Audit fields (present on every Client, Affiliate, Campaign, and Lead)

Every entity now carries the following audit and soft-delete fields:

| Field        | Type                 | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `created_by` | RequestActor         | Identity that created the record                               |
| `updated_by` | RequestActor \| null | Identity that last mutated the record                          |
| `deleted_by` | RequestActor \| null | Identity that soft-deleted the record; `null` when not deleted |

`RequestActor` shape: `{ sub, username, email, first_name, last_name, full_name }`. **Always use `full_name` to display a human-readable actor name.** Fall back to `email` only if `full_name` is absent (e.g. legacy records).
| `deleted_at` | ISO timestamp \| null | When the soft-delete occurred; `null` when not deleted |
| `is_deleted` | boolean | `true` when soft-deleted |
| `active` | boolean | Convenience inverse of `is_deleted` (`false` when deleted) |

Use `active` / `is_deleted` in the UI to show/hide deleted records without re-fetching.

### API error handling note

All endpoints **always return HTTP 200**, including business-logic rejections. Check the `success` field in the response body:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "Campaign is in test mode; send to /lead/test" }
```

Only network or Gateway-level failures return non-200 status codes (e.g. 401 for an invalid/missing Bearer token, 403 for an unregistered route).

## Endpoint walkthrough (key payloads)

Examples assume base `https://.../v2`.

- Internal API base (dev): `https://3ifu8b0q2h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v2`
- External leads API base (dev): `https://uj580pu31h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v2`

**Create client** `POST /clients`

```json
{
  "name": "Acme Corp",
  "email": "ops@acme.com",
  "phone": "+15551234567",
  "client_code": "ACME-001"
}
```

Response returns the client with `id` and timestamps.

**Create affiliate** `POST /affiliates`

```json
{
  "name": "Growth Partners",
  "email": "contact@growth.io",
  "phone": "+15559876543",
  "affiliate_code": "GROW-99"
}
```

**Update client** `PUT /clients/{id}`

All fields optional — only supplied fields are updated. Every change is recorded in the audit log automatically.

```json
{ "name": "New Name", "phone": "+15550001111", "status": "INACTIVE" }
```

**Update affiliate** `PUT /affiliates/{id}`

Same pattern — all fields optional. Every change is recorded in the audit log automatically.

```json
{ "name": "Updated Partner", "company": "New Co", "status": "INACTIVE" }
```

**Change history (clients, affiliates, leads, campaigns)**

All mutations — create, update, delete — are recorded in the centralized audit log. There is no `edit_history` field on entity objects; query the audit API instead.

See the [Audit Logs](#audit-logs) section for the full API reference and usage examples. Quick reference:

- `GET /audit/{entityId}` — full change history for one entity (e.g. `GET /audit/CLA0G9L9RF`)
- `GET /audit/activity?entity_type=client` — recent changes across all clients
- `GET /audit/activity?entity_type=campaign` — recent changes across all campaigns
- `GET /audit/activity?actor_sub=<cognito-sub>` — everything a specific user has done
- Add `&from=<ISO>&to=<ISO>` to either activity query to filter by date range

Each record includes `action` (`created` | `updated` | `deleted` | `soft_deleted` | ...) and a `changes[]` array of `{ field, from, to }` diffs. For create and delete events, `changes` is an empty array — the action itself is the record.

**Create campaign** `POST /campaigns`

```json
{ "name": "Spring Promo" }
```

Starts as `status=DRAFT`.

**Link client to campaign** `POST /campaigns/{id}/clients` (always TEST)

```json
{
  "client_id": "CLABC12345"
}
```

Adds `added_at` on the participant record.

**Link affiliate to campaign** `POST /campaigns/{id}/affiliates` (always TEST; returns `campaign_key`)

```json
{
  "affiliate_id": "AFABC12345"
}
```

Returns `campaign_key` plus updated campaign; affiliate participant also records `added_at`.

**Update linked participant status**

- Client: `PUT /campaigns/{id}/clients/{clientId}`
- Affiliate: `PUT /campaigns/{id}/affiliates/{affiliateId}`

```json
{ "status": "LIVE" }
```

Valid values: TEST, LIVE, DISABLED. Use these endpoints to move participants from TEST to LIVE (or disable); links always start in TEST.

**Update campaign name** `PUT /campaigns/{id}`

```json
{ "name": "Spring Promo (v2)" }
```

**Rotate affiliate campaign_key** `POST /campaigns/{id}/affiliates/{affiliateId}/rotate-key`

Returns updated campaign plus a new `campaign_key` for that affiliate. Use when a key is compromised or rotated as part of a security review.

**Remove linked participant**

- Client: `DELETE /campaigns/{id}/clients/{clientId}`
- Affiliate: `DELETE /campaigns/{id}/affiliates/{affiliateId}`
  Removal is blocked when the campaign has leads; disable the participant instead. Removal metadata is captured in `removed_clients` / `removed_affiliates`, and full change history is available via the audit log endpoints.

Participant and campaign state history is not embedded in campaign payloads. The frontend should source timelines from `GET /audit/{entityId}`.

**Get campaign by id** `GET /campaigns/{id}`

Returns the full campaign object including participants, plugins, and audit metadata fields.

**Delete campaign** `DELETE /campaigns/{id}` (soft) · `DELETE /campaigns/{id}?permanent=true` (hard)

Allowed only in DRAFT/TEST and only when the campaign has no linked clients/affiliates and no leads. Hard-delete is allowed only if the campaign never had participants or leads; otherwise, only soft-delete is permitted.

Soft-delete (default): sets `is_deleted=true`, `active=false`, records `deleted_by` + `deleted_at`.
Hard-delete: permanently removes the record from DynamoDB — irreversible.

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Campaign soft-deleted successfully",
  "data": { "id": "CMABC12345", "permanent": false }
}
```

**Soft-delete and hard-delete** — applies to clients, affiliates, campaigns, and leads

All `DELETE /{resource}/{id}` endpoints support two modes:

| Mode                    | URL                                   | What happens                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Soft-delete (default)   | `DELETE /clients/{id}`                | Sets `is_deleted=true`, `active=false`, records `deleted_by` + `deleted_at`. Record is hidden from normal queries but still in the DB. |
| Hard-delete (permanent) | `DELETE /clients/{id}?permanent=true` | Permanently removes the record from DynamoDB. Irreversible.                                                                            |

Response shape for all delete endpoints:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Client soft-deleted successfully",
  "data": { "id": "CLABC12345", "permanent": false }
}
```

`permanent: true` → hard-deleted (gone). `permanent: false` → soft-deleted (recoverable).

**Listing with soft-deleted records** — add `?includeDeleted=true` to any list endpoint:

- `GET /clients?includeDeleted=true`
- `GET /affiliates?includeDeleted=true`
- `GET /campaigns?includeDeleted=true`
- `GET /leads?includeDeleted=true`

Soft-deleted records have `is_deleted: true` and `active: false`. Use `active` to quickly filter in your frontend state.

```json
{ "status": "TEST" } // or "ACTIVE"
```

Rules:

- To TEST: requires at least one linked client and one linked affiliate.
- To ACTIVE: campaign must already be TEST, at least one LIVE client and one LIVE affiliate, and no participants remaining in TEST (DISABLED allowed but do not count as LIVE).

**Update campaign plugins** `PUT /campaigns/{id}/plugins`

```json
{
  "duplicate_check": {
    "enabled": true,
    "criteria": ["email"]
  },
  "trusted_form": {
    "enabled": true,
    "stage": 2,
    "gate": true,
    "vendor": "SummitEdgeLegal"
  },
  "ipqs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "stage": 3,
    "gate": true,
    "phone": { "enabled": true },
    "email": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `duplicate_check.enabled=true` requires at least one active criterion (`phone` or `email`).
- `trusted_form.stage` and `ipqs.stage` must be **≥ 2** — stage 1 is reserved for `duplicate_check` (returns 400 if violated).
- `gate` must be a boolean (returns 400 otherwise).
- `trusted_form.vendor` is optional; forwarded to TrustedForm during validation.
- Certificate claiming is configured at the delivery layer. `claim_trusted_form` is server-managed and always `true` in stored delivery config — not set via the plugins endpoint.
- When `duplicate_check.enabled=true`, duplicate matches are stored with `duplicate=true` and the lead is saved as `rejected=true`.
- When `duplicate_check.enabled=false`, duplicate-check does not reject leads.

**QA pipeline execution model**

Every lead submission runs through a configurable staged pipeline:

1. **Stage 1 — `duplicate_check`** (hardcoded, always a gate): runs first. If a duplicate is detected the pipeline halts immediately and the lead is saved as rejected.
2. **Stage 2+ — configurable plugins**: TrustedForm and IPQS each have a `stage` number (≥ 2). Stages are sorted ascending — lower numbers run before higher numbers. Plugins sharing the **same** stage number run **in parallel** (`Promise.all`). If any plugin in a stage has `gate: true` and its check fails, the pipeline halts and all later stages are skipped.

**Gate vs. soft-gate:**

| `gate`           | On failure                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true` (default) | Pipeline halts; later stages skipped; lead saved as `rejected=true`; `pipeline_halted=true` on the lead record.                               |
| `false`          | Failure is recorded (`trusted_form_result` / `ipqs_result`); pipeline continues to next stage; lead is **not** rejected by this plugin alone. |

> **Always saved:** all leads — including those rejected by missing required fields (criteria validation), logic rules, and downstream QA plugins — are written to DynamoDB. Rejected leads have `rejected=true`, `rejection_reason` (human-readable string), `rejection_errors` (array of per-field error strings for the frontend), and `active=false`.

**Submit test lead (external API)** `POST /leads/test`

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "CMABCDEFG",
  "campaign_key": "123456789012",
  "payload": { "email": "lead@test.com", "name": "Test Lead" }
}
```

Requirements: affiliate participant status TEST; campaign status TEST or ACTIVE; `campaign_key` matches the affiliate’s key.
**Submit live lead (external API)** `POST /leads`

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "CMABCDEFG",
  "campaign_key": "123456789012",
  "payload": { "email": "lead@example.com", "name": "Live Lead" }
}
```

Requirements: campaign status ACTIVE; affiliate participant status LIVE; `campaign_key` matches. If the affiliate is DISABLED, the lead is stored with `rejected=true`, `rejection_reason`, and `affiliate_status_at_intake`.

No API key required — authentication is entirely via `campaign_id` + `campaign_key`.

**Affiliate submission response** (`POST /leads` and `POST /leads/test`)

Both endpoints return two distinct shapes depending on outcome:

All responses share one shape: `result` is always present.

**Accepted (live):**

```json
{
  "result": "passed",
  "message": "Lead accepted",
  "data": {
    "lead_id": "LDABC12345",
    "message": "Your lead has been received and accepted."
  }
}
```

**Accepted (test endpoint):**

```json
{
  "result": "passed",
  "message": "Test lead accepted",
  "data": {
    "lead_id": "LDABC12345",
    "message": "Your test lead has been received and accepted."
  }
}
```

**Rejected — soft (criteria validation, logic rules, duplicate, affiliate disabled):**

```json
{
  "result": "failed",
  "lead_id": "LDABC12345",
  "message": "Lead Rejected",
  "errors": ["Last Name is required", "state must equal California"]
}
```

**Rejected — pre-validation (campaign inactive, wrong endpoint, etc.):**

```json
{
  "result": "failed",
  "message": "Lead rejected",
  "error": "Campaign is live; send to https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v2/leads"
}
```

- Always check `result === "failed"` vs `"passed"`. Use `error` for pre-validation failures and `errors[]` for field-level rejections.
- `lead_id` is present on soft-rejects — the lead is saved to DynamoDB so it can be reviewed internally. It is **not** present on pre-validation failures (no record created).
- The `submit_url` and `submit_url_test` fields on the campaign response give affiliates the exact URLs to POST to.

**Internal lead reads/updates/deletes (internal API only)**

- `GET /leads` — list all leads; supports `?campaign_id`, `?test`, `?includeDeleted=true`, `?limit`, `?lastEvaluatedKey`
- `GET /leads/{id}` — get single lead
- `GET /leads/intake-logs` — list raw intake logs for all incoming leads; supports `?campaign_id`, `?status=accepted|rejected|test`, `?from_date`, `?to_date`, `?limit`, `?lastEvaluatedKey`
- `PUT /leads/{id}` — update lead payload
- `DELETE /leads/{id}` — soft-delete; `DELETE /leads/{id}?permanent=true` for hard-delete

`POST /leads` and `POST /leads/test` are intentionally **not** exposed on the internal API.

### Cherry-pick operations (internal API)

Cherry-pick routes are internal-only and require Bearer auth:

- `GET /cherry-pick/eligible-clients?lead_id={leadId}` — list LIVE client destinations eligible for that lead
- `PATCH /cherry-pick/{leadId}/pickability` — set `{ "cherry_pickable": true|false }`
- `POST /cherry-pick/{leadId}/execute` — deliver lead to a selected client with optional skip flags:
  - `skip_trusted_form_claim`
  - `skip_duplicate_check`
  - `skip_ipqs_phone`
  - `skip_ipqs_email`
  - `skip_ipqs_ip`

When cherry-pick executes, the lead is explicitly updated with:

- `cherry_picked=true`
- `cherry_pickable=false`
- `cherry_pick_meta` (target client, executed by/at, delivery_result)
- `sold`, `sold_to_client_id`, `rejected`, `rejection_reason`, `rejection_errors`, `delivery_result`

### Intake logs (`GET /leads/intake-logs`)

Use this endpoint to power intake troubleshooting and audit screens. Each record is written for every inbound lead submission attempt (accepted, rejected, and test), including request context.

Response shape (trimmed):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Intake logs retrieved successfully",
  "count": 2,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "LDABC12345",
      "campaign_id": "CMABCDEFG",
      "received_at": "2026-03-15T18:44:11.000Z",
      "status": "rejected",
      "is_test": false,
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "phone": "5551234567",
      "raw_body": {
        "campaign_id": "CMABCDEFG",
        "payload": { "FIRST_NAME": "Jane" }
      },
      "raw_headers": { "content-type": "application/json" },
      "response_status_code": 200,
      "response_body": {
        "result": "failed",
        "lead_id": "LDABC12345",
        "message": "Lead Rejected",
        "errors": ["State is required"]
      },
      "rejection_reason": "Missing required field: State",
      "rejection_errors": ["State is required"]
    }
  ],
  "lastEvaluatedKey": "eyJjYW1wYWlnbl9pZCI6IkNNQUJDREVGRyIsInJlY2VpdmVkX2F0Ijoi..."
}
```

Use `status` for badges (`accepted`, `rejected`, `test`), `raw_body`/`raw_headers` to inspect what was sent, and `response_status_code` + `response_body` to render exactly what the API returned.

Delivery fields are also captured in each intake log record when available:

- `sold`: boolean accepted/not-accepted outcome from buyer delivery
- `sold_status`: one of `sold`, `not_sold`, `not_delivered`
- `sold_to_client_id`: buyer client ID when sold
- `delivery_result`: full webhook delivery attempt details (URL, method, status, body, acceptance match, error)

**Campaign response** (includes `submit_url`)

All campaign endpoints (`GET /campaigns/{id}`, `GET /campaigns`, etc.) include `submit_url` and `submit_url_test` at the top level of the campaign object:

```json
{
  "id": "CMABCDEFG",
  "name": "Summer Campaign",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "plugins": { "...": "..." },
  "submit_url": "https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v2/leads",
  "submit_url_test": "https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v2/leads/test"
}
```

Display these to affiliates so they know exactly where to submit leads.

**Internal lead shape** (`GET /leads/{id}` response `data`)

```json
{
  "id": "LDABC12345",
  "campaign_id": "CMABCDEFG",
  "campaign_key": "123456789012",
  "test": true,
  "payload": {
    "email": "...",
    "phone": "5551234567",
    "trusted_form_cert_id": "6e573ab8..."
  },
  "duplicate": false,
  "duplicate_matches": { "lead_ids": [] },
  "affiliate_status_at_intake": "TEST",
  "rejected": false,
  "rejection_reason": null,
  "rejection_errors": [],
  "pipeline_halted": false,
  "halt_stage": null,
  "halt_plugin": null,
  "halt_reason": null,
  "trusted_form_result": {
    "success": true,
    "cert_id": "6e573ab8abffbd1a3fdbbda781b177a3cf61c99a",
    "outcome": "success",
    "phone": "15551234567",
    "phone_match": true,
    "vendor": "SummitEdgeLegal",
    "previously_retained": false,
    "expires_at": "2026-06-03T22:48:05Z"
  },
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "created_by": {
    "sub": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "username": "affiliate-key",
    "email": null,
    "first_name": null,
    "last_name": null,
    "full_name": null
  },
  "updated_by": null,
  "deleted_by": null,
  "deleted_at": null,
  "is_deleted": false,
  "active": true
}
```

> **Note:** for leads submitted by external affiliates, `created_by` is populated from the JWT of the affiliate API call. If the affiliate's JWT contains no name claims, `full_name` will be `null` — fall back to `email` or `username` in that case.

````

`trusted_form_result` is `null` when TrustedForm is disabled or no credential is linked.

When the pipeline halts (`pipeline_halted=true`), the halt fields are populated:

```json
{
  "pipeline_halted": true,
  "halt_stage": 2,
  "halt_plugin": "trusted_form",
  "halt_reason": "The form certificate could not be verified. Please ensure the form was completed correctly and resubmit."
}
````

Rejection behavior:

- `rejected=true`, `active=false` when a required field is missing (criteria validation) — `rejection_errors` lists each missing field, e.g. `["Last Name is required"]`.
- `rejected=true`, `active=false` when a logic rule rejects the lead — `rejection_errors` lists each failing condition, e.g. `["state must equal California"]`.
- `rejected=true`, `active=false` when affiliate is DISABLED for the campaign — `rejection_reason`: _"This submission could not be accepted at this time."_
- `rejected=true`, `active=true` when duplicate-check detects a matching lead — `rejection_reason`: _"A matching lead has already been received for this contact."_
- `rejected=true`, `active=true` when a QA plugin has `gate=true` and its check fails — `rejection_reason` is a human-readable message from the failing plugin.
- `rejected=false`, `active=true` when none of the above apply.

Use `rejection_errors` (array) to display per-field error messages in the UI. Use `rejection_reason` as a fallback summary string when `rejection_errors` is absent.

## Base Criteria

Campaign base criteria define the expected lead payload structure. Each field has a `field_name` (snake_case key inside `payload`), a `data_type`, and a `required` flag. **Required fields gate lead intake** — a lead missing a required field is saved with `rejected=true` and a `rejection_reason` of `"Missing required field: {field_label}"` (or the plural form when multiple fields are absent). This check fires **before** duplicate-check and all QA plugins.

Criteria are managed via the internal API (Bearer token required on all endpoints below).

### Adding a field

**`POST /campaigns/{id}/criteria`**

Required fields in the body: `field_label`, `field_name` (snake_case, unique within the campaign), `data_type`.

```json
{
  "field_label": "State",
  "field_name": "state",
  "data_type": "Text",
  "required": true,
  "description": "US state — abbreviations are normalised to full names at intake",
  "state_mapping": "abbr_to_name"
}
```

For a `List` field, include an `options` array:

```json
{
  "field_label": "Lead Source",
  "field_name": "lead_source",
  "data_type": "List",
  "required": false,
  "options": [
    { "label": "Google", "value": "google" },
    { "label": "Facebook", "value": "facebook" },
    { "label": "Email", "value": "email" }
  ]
}
```

### Updating a field

**`PUT /campaigns/{id}/criteria/{fieldId}`** — all fields are optional (partial update):

```json
{ "required": true, "description": "Two-letter state abbreviation" }
```

To remove a `state_mapping`, send `"state_mapping": null`.

### Seeding standard base fields

**`POST /campaigns/{id}/criteria/base-fields`** — seeds the campaign with the platform-standard required fields in one call:

| field_name         | field_label      | data_type |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| `first_name`       | First Name       | Text      |
| `last_name`        | Last Name        | Text      |
| `phone`            | Phone            | Text      |
| `state`            | State            | US State  |
| `email`            | Email            | Text      |
| `ip_address`       | IP Address       | Text      |
| `marketing_source` | Marketing Source | Text      |
| `pub_id`           | Pub ID           | Text      |
| `campaign_id`      | Campaign ID      | Text      |
| `campaign_key`     | Campaign Key     | Text      |

All fields are seeded as `required: true`. Fields that already exist by `field_name` are silently skipped — safe to call multiple times.

No request body needed — just `POST` to the endpoint.

### Reordering fields

**`PUT /campaigns/{id}/criteria/reorder`** — supply the complete ordered list of all field IDs:

```json
{ "field_ids": ["CF000002", "CF000001", "CF000003"] }
```

Every existing field ID must be present; extra or missing IDs return a 400.

### Value mappings

Value mappings normalise raw affiliate input to canonical stored values **before** required-field validation runs. Each mapping rule has a `from` array (raw values, matched case-insensitively) and a single `to` value (what gets stored on the lead).

**`PUT /campaigns/{id}/criteria/{fieldId}/mappings`** — fully replaces the existing mappings:

```json
{
  "value_mappings": [
    { "from": ["M", "male", "m"], "to": "Male" },
    { "from": ["F", "female", "f"], "to": "Female" }
  ]
}
```

Send `{ "value_mappings": [] }` to clear all mappings.

> **Order matters:** if a raw value matches multiple `from` arrays, the first matching rule wins.

### US state mapping preset (`state_mapping`)

| Value            | Direction                | Example                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `"abbr_to_name"` | Abbreviation → full name | `"CA"` → `"California"` |
| `"name_to_abbr"` | Full name → abbreviation | `"California"` → `"CA"` |

The preset covers all 50 US states. It runs in addition to any custom `value_mappings` defined on the field (custom mappings are applied first). To disable, update the field with `"state_mapping": null`.

### Criteria audit trail

All criteria mutations are recorded in the centralized audit log with `entity_type: "campaign"` and the campaign's `id` as `entity_id`. Use `GET /audit/{campaignId}` to see the full change history for a campaign, including all criteria and logic rule events.

| Action                      | Trigger                                          | `changes[]` content                                                                                                       |

| `criteria_field_updated`    | `PUT /criteria/{fieldId}`                        | One entry per changed property: `{fieldId}.{property}` with `from`/`to` values                                            |
| `criteria_field_deleted`    | `DELETE /criteria/{fieldId}`                     | `field_id`, `field_name`, `field_label` (to `null`)                                                                       |

| `logic_rule_added`          | `POST /logic-rules`                              | `rule_id`, `name`, `action` (from `null`)                                                                                 |
| `logic_rule_updated`        | `PUT /logic-rules/{ruleId}`                      | One entry per changed scalar (`name`, `action`, `enabled`) + condition-level diffs for `groups` changes — see table below |
| `logic_rule_deleted`        | `DELETE /logic-rules/{ruleId}`                   | `rule_id`, `name`, `action` (to `null`)                                                                                   |
| `plugins_updated`           | `PUT /campaigns/{id}/plugins`                    | One entry per mutated plugin field — see table below                                                                      |

### Logic rule update audit trail

`logic_rule_updated` records are written whenever `PUT /logic-rules/{ruleId}` changes anything. Scalar fields produce one entry each; `groups` changes produce per-condition entries.

Condition matching is **content-based** (fingerprinted by `field_name + operator + value`). The frontend does not need to send condition `id` fields — only content matters. This prevents false "all removed + all added" events when condition IDs are omitted on update.

| `changes[].field`   | When emitted                                                      | `from` / `to` format                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | Rule name changed                                                 | Previous / new string                    |
| `action`            | Rule action changed (`pass` ↔ `fail`)                             | `"pass"` or `"fail"`                     |
| `enabled`           | Rule enabled toggled                                              | `true` or `false`                        |
| `condition.added`   | A net-new condition was added (by content)                        | `null` → `"field_name operator [value]"` |
| `condition.removed` | A net-removed condition was deleted (by content)                  | `"field_name operator [value]"` → `null` |
| `groups.structure`  | Only the grouping/ordering changed (no condition content changes) | `[["field op val"…], …]` before → after  |

The condition summary string format is `"{field_name} {operator} {value}"` — e.g. `"state is_not California"`. For multi-value `is`/`is_not` operators the values are joined with `, `.

Example `changes[]` for a rule update that renamed the rule, removed one condition, and added another:

```json
[
  { "field": "name", "from": "Old name", "to": "New name" },
  {
    "field": "condition.removed",
    "from": "state is_not California",
    "to": null
  },
  {
    "field": "condition.added",
    "from": null,
    "to": "state is Texas, Florida"
  }
]
```

### Plugin configuration audit trail

All changes made via `PUT /campaigns/{id}/plugins` are recorded with `entity_type: "campaign"` and `action: "plugins_updated"`. Each genuinely modified field produces one entry in `changes[]`. Fields present in the request but whose value is unchanged are excluded — comparison is deep structural equality, so property insertion order does not matter. Nothing is written if no fields actually changed.

| `ipqs.ip.criteria.country_code`   | IP country filter config object                      |
| `ipqs.ip.criteria.proxy`          | IP proxy check config object                         |
| `ipqs.ip.criteria.vpn`            | IP VPN check config object                           |

Example `changes[]` when only `ipqs.phone.criteria.country` was enabled — no other fields appear even if they were referenced in the request body:

```json
[
  {
    "field": "ipqs.phone.criteria.country",
    "from": { "enabled": false, "allowed": [] },
    "to": { "enabled": true, "allowed": ["US"] }
  }
]
```

Example `changes[]` for a fraud-score threshold change:

```json
[
  {
    "field": "ipqs.phone.criteria.fraud_score",
    "from": { "enabled": true, "operator": "lte", "value": 85 },
    "to": { "enabled": true, "operator": "lte", "value": 75 }
  }
]
```

### Criteria-validation rejection messages

When a lead is rejected by criteria validation the response includes:

```json
{
  "id": "LDABC12345",
  "rejected": true,
  "rejection_reason": "Missing required field: State"
}
```

| Scenario                         | `rejection_reason`                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| One required field missing       | `"Missing required field: {field_label}"`       |
| Multiple required fields missing | `"Missing required fields: {label1}, {label2}"` |

Criteria validation **fails open** — if the criteria-validation lambda itself errors, the lead is allowed through (not rejected). This ensures a lambda cold-start or transient error never silently drops a lead.

> **Intake order:** criteria-validation → duplicate-check → QA plugins (TrustedForm, IPQS). A criteria-validation rejection does not run the QA pipeline.

## Posting Instructions

`POST /campaigns/{id}/posting-instructions/generate`

Generates a structured posting instructions document for a specific affiliate linked to a campaign. Use this to build a PDF or on-screen guide showing the affiliate exactly what fields to submit and how.

### Request body

```json
{ "affiliate_id": "AFF-xxxx" }
```

### Response `data` shape

```json
{
  "campaign": {
    "id": "CMP-xxxx",
    "name": "Home Insurance Q3",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "submit_url": "https://leads.example.com",
    "submit_url_test": "https://leads.example.com/test"
  },
  "affiliate": {
    "id": "AFF-xxxx",
    "name": "Acme Partners",
    "campaign_key": "abc123xyz",
    "link_status": "LIVE"
  },
  "criteria_fields": [
    {
      "field_name": "first_name",
      "field_label": "First Name",
      "data_type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "field_name": "state",
      "field_label": "State",
      "data_type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "state_mapping": "abbr_to_name",
      "order": 2
    }
  ],
  "generated_at": "2025-06-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`criteria_fields` are sorted by `order` (ascending). Optional fields (`description`, `options`, `state_mapping`) are only present when set on the campaign.

### Errors

| Condition                                    | Response                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Campaign not found or soft-deleted           | `{ "success": false, "error": "Campaign CMP-... not found" }` (404)         |
| Affiliate not linked to campaign             | `{ "success": false, "error": "Affiliate AFF-... is not linked..." }` (400) |
| Affiliate record missing in affiliates table | `{ "success": false, "error": "Affiliate AFF-... not found" }` (404)        |

### Audit trail

Each call writes a `posting_instructions_generated` audit event with `entity_type: "campaign"`:

| `changes[].field` | `from` | `to`                      |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `affiliate_id`    | `null` | The affiliate's ID string |

## UI hints

- Show campaign status plus per-participant statuses; allow toggling participant status via the participant PUT endpoints.
- Surface `campaign_key` to affiliates once linked; they need it for both test and live lead intake.
- When sending leads, display backend message and `rejected` flag to make DISABLED affiliate behavior clear.
- Display duplicate metadata: `duplicate=true` means lead matched existing campaign leads; use `duplicate_matches.lead_ids` to show linked duplicates.
- Only enable “Activate campaign” when the rules above are satisfied (LIVE participants present, none left in TEST).
- **Change history**: display entity change history on client, affiliate, lead, and campaign detail views by querying `GET /audit/{entityId}`. Each entry shows `action`, field-level diffs (`changes[].field`, `changes[].from → changes[].to`), `changed_at`, and `actor.full_name`. Fall back to `actor.email` only when `full_name` is absent. See the [Audit Logs](#audit-logs) section for full query patterns.
- **Soft-delete UI**: use `active` (boolean) to control visibility. Show a "deleted" badge or hide the row when `active=false`. Offer a restore action that calls `PUT /users/{id}/enable` (users) or a future restore endpoint for other entities.
- **Audit trail**: display `created_by` and `updated_by` in detail views / tooltips. Show `deleted_by` + `deleted_at` in soft-deleted record summaries.
- **All responses are HTTP 200** — check `success` (boolean) in the body, not the HTTP status, to determine if an operation succeeded. On `success: false`, display the `error` field to the user.

## Internal login

The internal API uses custom Bearer token auth backed by Cognito. No OAuth redirects or hosted UI needed — your login screen calls the backend directly.

### Login

`POST /v2/auth/login` — no Authorization header needed on this call.

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "UserPassword1!"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "access_token": "eyJ...",
    "id_token": "eyJ...",
    "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
  }
}
```

- Store `id_token` and `refresh_token` (e.g. in memory / httpOnly cookie).
- Send `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` on every internal API call. **Important: use `id_token`, not `access_token`** — the API Gateway Cognito authorizer validates ID tokens.
- `id_token` expires in 1 hour by default.

### Token refresh

`POST /v2/auth/refresh` — call before the access_token expires or when you receive a 401.

```json
{ "refresh_token": "<refresh_token from login>" }
```

Response is the same shape as login (`data.access_token`, `data.id_token`, `data.expires_in`). No new `refresh_token` is issued on refresh; use the original.

### Error handling

- `401` with `success: false` means invalid credentials or expired/invalid token.
- On 401 from any protected endpoint: try `/v2/auth/refresh`; if that also returns 401, redirect to login.

### Notes

- Cognito User Pool ID and Client ID are server-side details managed by the backend. The frontend does **not** need them.
- Do **not** implement the Cognito hosted UI, OAuth redirect, or PKCE flow — the custom login endpoint replaces all of that.

## Frontend dev env values (current)

Minimal values needed for frontend integration:

```dotenv
VITE_INTERNAL_API_BASE_URL=https://3ifu8b0q2h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v2
VITE_EXTERNAL_LEADS_API_BASE_URL=https://uj580pu31h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v2
```

The internal API URL already includes `/v2`. The external API URL also includes `/v2`. No API keys or Cognito OAuth URLs are needed on the frontend.

> **Login credentials** are managed server-side (Cognito User Pool). Use `POST /v2/users` (admin only) or `scripts/create-cognito-user.sh` to provision users. The frontend only needs email + password for the login form — it calls `POST /v2/auth/login` and stores the returned `id_token`.

## Helper scripts

- Full flow smoke test (interactive): [scripts/test-api.sh](scripts/test-api.sh)
  - Menu-driven: choose auth / clients / affiliates / campaigns / all
  - Non-interactive: `./scripts/test-api.sh --suite=auth`
  - Auth suite: logs in, validates token grants access to `GET /leads`, validates requests without a token get 401
- Interactive lead-only helper: [scripts/send-lead.sh](scripts/send-lead.sh)
  - Usage: `./scripts/send-lead.sh https://your-api/dev/v2`
  - Prompts for campaign_id, campaign_key, lead type (test/live), and payload JSON; prints HTTP status and response body.
- Frontend auth/API handoff values: [scripts/get-auth-values.sh](scripts/get-auth-values.sh)
  - Usage:
    - `source ./scripts/env-dev.sh`
    - `./scripts/get-auth-values.sh`
  - Prints copy/paste values for frontend `.env` (internal and external API base URLs).
- Cognito user provisioning: [scripts/create-cognito-user.sh](scripts/create-cognito-user.sh)
  - Usage:
    - `source ./scripts/env-dev.sh`
    - `./scripts/create-cognito-user.sh --email dev1@company.com --password 'StrongPass123!'`
  - Creates (or updates) the user in the internal API user pool and sets permanent password.

## User management (admin only)

All `/v2/users` endpoints require an admin Bearer token (`id_token` from an account in the Cognito `admin` group). Staff users receive a `403 Forbidden`.

### Roles

- `admin` — full access including all user management endpoints.
- `staff` — can access all other internal API endpoints; cannot manage users.

Role is included in the `cognito:groups` claim of the `id_token`. New users default to `staff` if no role is specified.

### Create user

`POST /v2/users` — creates a Cognito user with a permanent password and assigns the role group. The `role` field is **required for UI** so you can offer a dropdown of `staff`/`admin` when building your form; if omitted the backend defaults to `staff`.

```json
{
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "password": "TempPass1!",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "role": "staff" // "admin" or "staff"
}
```

Returns `201` with the new user object. `role` defaults to `staff` if omitted.

### List users

`GET /v2/users` — returns all Cognito users with their assigned role.

### Get user

`GET /v2/users/{id}` — where `{id}` is the URL-encoded email/username. E.g. `jane%40example.com`.

### Update user (role and/or name)

`PUT /v2/users/{id}` — all fields are optional; include only what you want to change.

**Role only** (`admin` or `staff`):

```json
{ "role": "admin" }
```

**Name only:**

```json
{ "firstName": "Edgar", "lastName": "Velasco" }
```

**Both at once:**

```json
{ "role": "staff", "firstName": "Jane", "lastName": "Doe" }
```

At least one field must be present. Fields not included are left unchanged.

> **Role change note:** After changing a user's role, they must re-login to receive a fresh `id_token` with the updated `cognito:groups` claim. Name changes take effect immediately — no re-login needed.

### Reset password

`PUT /v2/users/{id}/password` — sets a new permanent password without requiring the current one.

```json
{ "password": "NewPass1!" }
```

### Disable user (soft-delete)

`DELETE /v2/users/{id}` — disables the Cognito account (`AdminDisableUser`). The account is preserved but the user cannot log in. `enabled` on the user object becomes `false`.

### Re-enable user

`PUT /v2/users/{id}/enable` — re-enables a previously disabled account (`AdminEnableUser`). No request body needed. Returns the updated user object with `enabled: true`.

### Delete user (permanent)

There is no permanent user delete endpoint; `DELETE /v2/users/{id}` is always a soft-disable.

### User object shape

```json
{
  "username": "jane@example.com",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "enabled": true,
  "role": "staff",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

> **Navbar tip:** Use `firstName` + `lastName` for the welcome message and derive initials from their first characters (`firstName[0] + lastName[0]`). Both fields are optional — fall back to the `email` prefix if either is absent.

## Tenant credentials (DynamoDB-backed)

Credentials are stored in the `tenant-settings` DynamoDB table with sensitive fields encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM). Each record has an auto-generated `CR-…` ID. Credentials are global, admin-managed resources — they are **not** set on individual campaigns.

### Endpoints

| Method   | Path                                      | Description                                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/tenant-config/credentials`              | Create a credential                                                         |
| `GET`    | `/tenant-config/credentials`              | List all credentials (optional `?provider=` filter, `?includeDeleted=true`) |
| `GET`    | `/tenant-config/credentials/{id}`         | Get credential by ID                                                        |
| `PUT`    | `/tenant-config/credentials/{id}`         | Update credential                                                           |
| `PUT`    | `/tenant-config/credentials/{id}/disable` | Soft-disable a credential                                                   |
| `PUT`    | `/tenant-config/credentials/{id}/enable`  | Re-enable a disabled credential                                             |
| `PUT`    | `/tenant-config/credentials/{id}/restore` | Restore a soft-deleted credential                                           |
| `DELETE` | `/tenant-config/credentials/{id}`         | Soft-delete (default) or hard-delete (`?permanent=true`)                    |

### Credential record shape

```json
{
  "id": "CRA1B2C3D4",
  "provider": "trusted_form",
  "name": "TrustedForm Prod",
  "credential_type": "basic_auth",
  "credentials": {
    "username": "API",
    "password": "de3b2f39..."
  },
  "vendor": "MyVendor",
  "enabled": true,
  "is_deleted": false,
  "active": true,
  "deleted_at": null,
  "deleted_by": null,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Supported `credential_type` values: `api_key`, `basic_auth`, `bearer_token`

> The `type` field is now named `credential_type` to avoid collision with the DynamoDB record-type discriminator.

Sensitive field per type:

- `api_key` → `credentials.apiKey` (encrypted)
- `basic_auth` → `credentials.password` (encrypted); `credentials.username` (plaintext)
- `bearer_token` → `credentials.token` (encrypted)

### Creating a TrustedForm credential

```json
POST /v2/tenant-config/credentials
{
  "provider": "trusted_form",
  "name": "TrustedForm Prod",
  "type": "basic_auth",
  "credentials": {
    "username": "API",
    "password": "de3b2f39055939221023f0325f33d25a"
  },
  "vendor": "SummitEdgeLegal"
}
```

Response includes the new record with `id: "CRXXXXXXXX"`. The credential is now available globally for use by the plugin system.

### Soft-delete vs hard-delete

All three record types (credentials, credential schemas, plugin settings) support both soft and hard deletion:

- **Soft-delete** (default): Sets `is_deleted=true`, `active=false`, records `deleted_at` / `deleted_by`. Record is hidden from normal list responses but can be restored.
- **Hard-delete** (`?permanent=true`): Permanently removes the record. Blocked with a `400` if the record is still referenced — a credential cannot be hard-deleted while plugin settings point to it, and a schema cannot be hard-deleted while credentials reference it.
- **Restore**: `PUT /{id}/restore` to undo a soft-delete.

### Change history (audit trail)

All mutations to credentials, credential schemas, and plugin settings are recorded in the centralized audit log. Use the audit API to surface change history in admin views:

- `GET /audit/{id}` — full history for a single credential, schema, or plugin setting record
- `GET /audit/activity?entity_type=credential` — recent changes across all credentials
- `GET /audit/activity?entity_type=credential_schema` — recent changes across all credential schemas
- `GET /audit/activity?entity_type=plugin_setting` — recent changes across all plugin settings

Tracked actions per entity type:

| Entity type         | Tracked actions                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `credential`        | `created`, `updated`, `soft_deleted`, `hard_deleted`, `restored`, `credential_disabled`, `credential_enabled`         |
| `credential_schema` | `created`, `updated`, `soft_deleted`, `hard_deleted`, `restored`                                                      |
| `plugin_setting`    | `created`, `updated`, `soft_deleted`, `hard_deleted`, `restored`, `plugin_setting_disabled`, `plugin_setting_enabled` |

See the [Audit Logs](#audit-logs) section for the full API reference.

### Disable / enable a credential

Credentials can be soft-disabled (keeps the record, marks it inactive) and re-enabled later:

```
PUT /v2/tenant-config/credentials/{id}/disable
PUT /v2/tenant-config/credentials/{id}/enable
```

A disabled credential returns `enabled: false` in its record. The `validate` endpoint will not use a disabled credential when auto-resolving.

### TrustedForm validate (QA Orchestrator)

This is the **single exposed HTTP endpoint** for TrustedForm certificate validation on the QA Orchestrator handler (`/qa/`). It proxies directly to `https://cert.trustedform.com/{cert_id}/validate`. Credentials are always resolved automatically from the globally configured `trusted_form` plugin setting in the tenant settings table — no credential ID is accepted from the caller:

```json
POST /v2/qa/trusted-form/validate
{
  "cert_id": "6e573ab8abffbd1a3fdbbda781b177a3cf61c99a"
}
```

`cert_id` accepts either a bare 40-char hex ID or a full `https://cert.trustedform.com/…` URL.

Response `data` is the raw TrustedForm validate API response:

```json
{ "outcome": "success" }
// or
{ "outcome": "failure", "reason": "Expired" }
```

> Duplicate-check and full lead validation are **lambda-to-lambda only** — there are no HTTP routes for those operations.

### Lead intake with TrustedForm

The lead payload should include `trusted_form_cert_id` and optionally `phone` (used for phone-match verification during the retain/claim step):

```json
POST /v2/leads
{
  "campaign_id": "CM...",
  "campaign_key": "...",
  "payload": {
    "phone": "5551234567",
    "email": "lead@example.com",
    "trusted_form_cert_id": "6e573ab8abffbd1a3fdbbda781b177a3cf61c99a"
  }
}
```

If `trusted_form.enabled = true`, the orchestrator will resolve the default `trusted_form` credential via the plugin settings table, validate + claim the cert, and store the result on the lead as `trusted_form_result`.

**Success (cert valid, phone matched):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cert_id": "6e573ab8abffbd1a3fdbbda781b177a3cf61c99a",
  "outcome": "success",
  "phone": "15551234567",
  "phone_match": true,
  "vendor": "SummitEdgeLegal",
  "previously_retained": false,
  "expires_at": "2026-06-03T22:48:05Z"
}
```

**Rejection — cert invalid or expired (validate step failed):**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "cert_id": "6e573ab8abffbd1a3fdbbda781b177a3cf61c99a",
  "outcome": "failure",
  "error": "Expired",
  "phone": "15551234567"
}
```

**Rejection — phone mismatch (cert retained but lead rejected):**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "cert_id": "6e573ab8abffbd1a3fdbbda781b177a3cf61c99a",
  "outcome": "failure",
  "phone": "15551234567",
  "phone_match": false,
  "vendor": "SummitEdgeLegal",
  "previously_retained": true,
  "expires_at": "2026-06-03T22:48:05Z"
}
```

> **UI hint:** Use `trusted_form_result.success` to show a pass/fail badge on the lead detail view. When `success: false`, display `trusted_form_result.outcome` + `error` (validate failure) or `phone_match: false` (retain failure) to explain why it was rejected. `previously_retained: true` means the cert was already claimed by a prior lead.

- External leads API is isolated to POST-only intake routes. No API key required.

### IPQS (IPQualityScore) plugin

IPQS runs fraud-score checks on phone, email, and IP address at lead-intake time (lambda-to-lambda only). A proxy HTTP endpoint is also available for manual/test checks.

#### Campaign plugin configuration

Enable IPQS on a campaign via `PUT /campaigns/{id}/plugins`. The `ipqs` block mirrors TrustedForm in structure but has three independent sub-checks:

```json
{
  "ipqs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "phone": {
      "enabled": true,
      "criteria": {
        "valid": { "enabled": true, "required": true },
        "fraud_score": { "enabled": true, "operator": "lte", "value": 75 },
        "country": { "enabled": true, "allowed": ["US", "CA"] }
      }
    },
    "email": {
      "enabled": true,
      "criteria": {
        "valid": { "enabled": true, "required": true },
        "fraud_score": { "enabled": true, "operator": "lte", "value": 75 }
      }
    },
    "ip": {
      "enabled": true,
      "criteria": {
        "fraud_score": { "enabled": true, "operator": "lte", "value": 75 },
        "country_code": { "enabled": false, "allowed": [] },
        "proxy": { "enabled": true, "allowed": false },
        "vpn": { "enabled": true, "allowed": false }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `ipqs.enabled` is the **master toggle** — all sub-checks are skipped when false.
- Criteria operators: `lte` = score ≤ value, `gte` = score ≥ value, `eq` = exact match.
- IPQS **must be enabled** before a campaign can be promoted to `ACTIVE` (along with `duplicate_check` and `trusted_form`).

#### Lead intake with IPQS

Include `email` and/or `ip_address` in the lead payload alongside `phone`:

```json
POST /v2/leads
{
  "campaign_id": "CM...",
  "campaign_key": "...",
  "payload": {
    "phone": "5551234567",
    "email": "lead@example.com",
    "ip_address": "8.8.8.8"
  }
}
```

The result is stored on the lead as `ipqs_result`:

```json
{
  "ipqs_result": {
    "success": true,
    "phone": {
      "success": true,
      "criteria_results": {
        "valid": true,
        "fraud_score": true,
        "country": true
      }
    },
    "email": {
      "success": true,
      "criteria_results": { "valid": true, "fraud_score": true }
    },
    "ip": {
      "success": true,
      "criteria_results": { "fraud_score": true, "proxy": true, "vpn": true }
    }
  }
}
```

`ipqs_result` is omitted when IPQS is disabled or no credential is configured.

#### IPQS proxy check endpoint

`POST /v2/qa/ipqs/check` — runs a check directly without a lead submission. At least one field is required:

```json
{ "phone": "5551234567", "email": "lead@example.com", "ip_address": "8.8.8.8" }
```

Credentials are auto-resolved from the active `ipqs` plugin setting in tenant config.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "phone": { "success": true, "raw": { ... } },
    "email": { "success": true, "raw": { ... } },
    "ip":    { "success": false, "error": "Proxy detected" }
  }
}
```

> **UI hint:** Use `ipqs_result.success` for an overall pass/fail badge. Drill into `ipqs_result.phone`, `.email`, `.ip` for per-check details and `criteria_results` for per-criterion breakdown.

Credential schemas describe the credential fields that each plugin integration requires. The frontend reads these records to **dynamically render the credential creation form** — instead of hard-coding a form per plugin, it renders the fields defined in the schema.

| Method   | Path                                             | Description                                                                                   |

| `DELETE` | `/tenant-config/credential-schemas/{id}`         | Soft-delete (default) or hard-delete (`?permanent=true`, blocked if credentials reference it) |

### Credential schema record shape

```json
{
  "id": "CSa1b2c3d4",
  "provider": "trusted_form",
  "name": "TrustedForm",
  "credential_type": "basic_auth",
  "description": "TrustedForm certificate verification integration",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "username",
      "label": "Username",
      "type": "text",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter your TrustedForm username"
    },
    {
      "name": "password",
      "label": "Password",
      "type": "password",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter your TrustedForm password"
    }
  ],
  "is_deleted": false,
  "active": true,
  "deleted_at": null,
  "deleted_by": null,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

> IDs are now **CS-prefixed** (was PS). Schemas now carry full audit fields: `is_deleted`, `active`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by`.

### Field types

| `type`     | Rendered as                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `text`     | Plain text input (username, API key label, etc.) |
| `password` | Password input — value masked in the browser     |
| `select`   | Dropdown — must include `options: string[]`      |

### Creating a credential schema

```json
POST /v2/tenant-config/credential-schemas
{
  "provider": "trusted_form",
  "name": "TrustedForm",
  "credential_type": "basic_auth",
  "description": "TrustedForm certificate verification integration",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "username", "label": "Username",  "type": "text",     "required": true  },
    { "name": "password", "label": "Password",  "type": "password", "required": true  }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend usage pattern

1. On the **credential creation page**, call `GET /v2/tenant-config/credential-schemas` to retrieve all schemas.
2. When the user selects a plugin (e.g. "TrustedForm"), look up the matching schema by `provider`.
3. Render each entry in `fields` as a form input using the field's `type`, `label`, `placeholder`, and `required` attributes.
4. On submit, build the `credentials` object using `field.name` as the key and the user's input as the value.
5. `POST /v2/tenant-config/credentials` with `credential_type` taken from `schema.credential_type`.
6. Include `schema_id: schema.id` in the request to hard-link the credential to its schema (enables grouping by plugin in the UI).

```typescript
// Example: building the credentials payload from schema fields
const schema = schemas.find((s) => s.provider === selectedProvider);
const credentials = Object.fromEntries(
  schema.fields.map((field) => [field.name, formValues[field.name]]),
);

await api.post("/tenant-config/credentials", {
  provider: schema.provider,
  schema_id: schema.id, // ← link credential to its credential schema
  name: credentialLabel,
  type: schema.credential_type,
  credentials,
});
```

## Global plugin settings (default credential per plugin)

Plugin settings let an admin set a **global default credential** for each plugin. The lead processing orchestrator resolves credentials through this table — there is no per-campaign credential override.

**Important**: The Plugin Settings page is driven by a **canonical registry** (`AVAILABLE_PLUGINS`), not by credential-schema count. There are always exactly 2 plugin cards (TrustedForm, IPQS) regardless of how many schemas or credentials exist. To add a new plugin in the future, add it to the `AVAILABLE_PLUGINS` constant in the backend.

### Endpoints

| Method   | Path                                                | Description                                                                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/tenant-config/plugins`                            | **Registry** — static list of all available plugins with metadata (no DB call, safe to cache) |
| `GET`    | `/tenant-config/plugin-settings`                    | List global plugin settings — always exactly N entries, **enriched with registry metadata**   |
| `GET`    | `/tenant-config/plugin-settings/{provider}`         | Get the global setting for a plugin by provider                                               |
| `PUT`    | `/tenant-config/plugin-settings/{provider}`         | Set (upsert) the global setting for a plugin                                                  |
| `PUT`    | `/tenant-config/plugin-settings/{provider}/restore` | Restore a soft-deleted plugin setting                                                         |
| `DELETE` | `/tenant-config/plugin-settings/{provider}`         | Soft-delete (default) or hard-delete (`?permanent=true`)                                      |

> `{provider}` is the canonical plugin identifier: `trusted_form` or `ipqs`. Never a schema ID.

### GET /tenant-config/plugins — available plugin registry

Returns the static `AVAILABLE_PLUGINS` list with no database call. Use this to know what plugins the platform supports and what credential type each requires.

```json
// GET /v2/tenant-config/plugins
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Available plugins retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "provider": "trusted_form",
      "name": "TrustedForm",
      "credential_type": "basic_auth",
      "description": "TrustedForm certificate verification for lead compliance tracking."
    },
    {
      "provider": "ipqs",
      "name": "IPQS",
      "credential_type": "api_key",
      "description": "IP Quality Score fraud and validity checks."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Plugin setting record shape (enriched `PluginView`)

`GET /plugin-settings` returns a **`PluginView`** for each entry — the setting record enriched with registry metadata. The frontend gets everything it needs in a single call; no separate registry fetch required.

```json
{
  "id": "PGA1B2C3D4",
  "provider": "trusted_form",
  "credentials_id": "CRA1B2C3D4",
  "enabled": true,
  "is_deleted": false,
  "active": true,
  "deleted_at": null,
  "deleted_by": null,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "name": "TrustedForm",
  "credential_type": "basic_auth",
  "description": "TrustedForm certificate verification for lead compliance tracking."
}
```

> Plugins that have never been configured are returned by the list endpoint with `id: ""`, `credentials_id: null`, and `enabled: false` — but still include the full `name`, `credential_type`, and `description` fields from the registry.

### Setting the global default for a plugin

```json
PUT /v2/tenant-config/plugin-settings/trusted_form
{
  "credentials_id": "CRA1B2C3D4",
  "enabled": true
}
```

- `credentials_id` is **optional** — omit it to enable/register the plugin without assigning a credential yet.
- If no setting exists for this provider, a new one is created.
- If one already exists, it is **overwritten** (upsert semantics).
- The `provider` must match an entry in `AVAILABLE_PLUGINS` or the request returns a 400.

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Plugin setting saved successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "PGA1B2C3D4",
    "provider": "trusted_form",
    "credentials_id": "CRA1B2C3D4",
    "enabled": true,
    "is_deleted": false,
    "active": true,
    "deleted_at": null,
    "deleted_by": null,
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-06-01T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Settings page workflow (Credentials + Plugins tabs)

**Credentials tab**

1. `GET /v2/tenant-config/credential-schemas` — load all schemas (for grouping & schema_id lookup).
2. `GET /v2/tenant-config/credentials` — load all credentials.
3. Group credentials by `provider` (e.g. `trusted_form`, `ipqs`).
4. Render an "Add credential" button per group that opens a schema-driven modal.

**Plugins tab**

1. `GET /v2/tenant-config/plugin-settings` — returns exactly one `PluginView` per canonical plugin. Each entry already includes `name`, `description`, and `credential_type` from the registry — no separate registry call needed.
2. `GET /v2/tenant-config/credentials` — load all credentials for the credential dropdown.
3. For each plugin view: render the plugin card using `name` and `description`, show the enabled toggle (`plugin.enabled`), and populate the credential dropdown with credentials filtered by `provider`.
4. A dropdown per plugin lists only the credentials with a matching `provider` field.
5. On change: `PUT /v2/tenant-config/plugin-settings/{provider}` with `{ credentials_id, enabled }`.

> Use `GET /v2/tenant-config/plugins` instead if you only need the registry metadata without current setting state (e.g. capability checks, onboarding flows, or building a "supported plugins" reference page).

```typescript
// Example: loading the plugins tab — one enriched call, no separate registry fetch
const [pluginViews, credentials] = await Promise.all([
  api.get("/tenant-config/plugin-settings").then((r) => r.data.data),
  api.get("/tenant-config/credentials").then((r) => r.data.data),
]);

// Each pluginView already has: name, description, credential_type, credentials_id, enabled
const pluginRows = pluginViews.map((plugin) => ({
  ...plugin,
  availableCredentials: credentials.filter(
    (c) => c.provider === plugin.provider && !c.is_deleted,
  ),
}));
```

### Globally disabled plugins

When `enabled = false` on a plugin setting the frontend should **hide that plugin** from the campaign plugin configuration panel so operators cannot accidentally enable a globally disabled integration on individual campaigns.

TrustedForm certificate validation and IPQS checks are handled by the QA Orchestrator lambda. Duplicate-check and full lead validation are lambda-to-lambda only (no HTTP routes):

| Method | Path                        | Description                                                         |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/qa/trusted-form/validate` | Validate cert using globally configured plugin-setting credentials  |
| `POST` | `/qa/ipqs/check`            | Run an IPQS fraud-score check using globally configured credentials |

---

## Audit Logs

All mutating operations (create, update, delete, role changes, password resets) are recorded in a centralized `audit-logs` DynamoDB table. The audit Lambda exposes three endpoints — all require an admin Bearer token.

### Audit record shape

Every audit log entry (`AuditLogItem`) has this structure:

```typescript
interface AuditLogItem {
  log_id: string; // ULID — lexicographically ordered by creation time
  entity_id: string; // ID of the entity that was changed
  entity_type: // Type of entity
    | "lead"
    | "campaign"
    | "client"
    | "affiliate"
    | "credential"
    | "credential_schema"
    | "plugin_setting"
    | "user";
  action: // What happened
    | "created"
    | "updated"
    | "deleted"
    | "soft_deleted"
    | "restored"
    | "status_changed"
    | "key_rotated"
    | "participant_linked"
    | "participant_updated"
    | "participant_removed"
    | "criteria_field_added"
    | "criteria_field_updated"
    | "criteria_field_deleted"
    | "criteria_fields_reordered"
    | "logic_rule_added"
    | "logic_rule_updated"
    | "logic_rule_deleted"
    | "mappings_updated"
    | "value_mapped"
    | "plugins_updated"
    | "hard_deleted"
    | "credential_disabled"
    | "credential_enabled"
    | "plugin_setting_disabled"
    | "plugin_setting_enabled"
    | "password_reset"
    | "posting_instructions_generated"
    // Delivery & routing
    | "delivery_config_updated"
    | "distribution_updated"
    | "lead_cap_updated"
    | "cert_claimed"
    | "delivery_skipped"
    | "lead_delivered"
    // Participant lifecycle (stored on campaign entity)
    | "client_linked"
    | "client_status_updated"
    | "client_deleted"
    | "affiliate_linked"
    | "affiliate_status_updated"
    | "affiliate_deleted"
    | "affiliate_key_rotated";
  changes: Array<{
    field: string;
    from: unknown; // Previous value (null for newly created fields)
    to: unknown; // New value (null for deleted fields)
  }>;
  actor?: {
    sub?: string; // Cognito sub — use this for actor_sub queries
    username?: string;
    email?: string;
    first_name?: string;
    last_name?: string;
    full_name?: string; // Always prefer full_name for display
  };
  changed_at: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp of the mutation
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD — used for S3 export partitioning
  actor_sub: string; // Cognito sub of the actor (GSI key)
}
```

### Pagination

Both audit query endpoints return cursor-based pagination:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "items": [...],
    "nextCursor": "eyJlbnRpdHlfaWQiOiI..."
  }
}
```

Pass `nextCursor` as the `cursor` query parameter in the next request. When `nextCursor` is absent (or null), you have reached the last page.

### API endpoints

| Method | Path                | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/audit`            | Full table scan — all records, paginated, no filter required        |
| `GET`  | `/audit/activity`   | Cross-entity activity feed — filter by `entity_type` or `actor_sub` |
| `GET`  | `/audit/{entityId}` | Full history for a single entity                                    |
| `POST` | `/audit/export`     | Manually trigger an S3 NDJSON export for a given date               |

All require `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` (admin role).

**GET `/audit`** — Full table scan with cursor-based pagination. No filters required.

| Parameter | Required        | Description                              |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `limit`   | No (default 50) | Max records to return (1–500)            |
| `cursor`  | No              | Pagination cursor from previous response |

Results are in DynamoDB scan order (not sorted by date). Iterate using `nextCursor` until it is absent to retrieve all records.

**GET `/audit/activity`** — Query parameters:

| Parameter     | Required                   | Description                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `entity_type` | One of the two is required | Filter by entity type                    |
| `actor_sub`   | One of the two is required | Filter by Cognito sub of the actor       |
| `from`        | No                         | ISO 8601 start timestamp (inclusive)     |
| `to`          | No                         | ISO 8601 end timestamp (inclusive)       |
| `limit`       | No (default 50)            | Max records to return (1–500)            |
| `cursor`      | No                         | Pagination cursor from previous response |

**GET `/audit/{entityId}`** — Full change history for one entity, ordered newest-first.

This is the primary endpoint for building a changelog or history panel in the frontend. Pass the entity's `id` field directly — for a campaign use `campaignId`, for a lead use `leadId`, for a client use `clientId`, etc.

```typescript
// Full history for a campaign (includes participant changes, delivery config, distribution, caps)
const history = await api.get(`/audit/${campaignId}`, {
  params: { limit: 50 },
});

// Full history for a specific lead (intake, delivery, cert claim)
const leadHistory = await api.get(`/audit/${leadId}`, {
  params: { limit: 50 },
});

// Full history for a client record
const clientHistory = await api.get(`/audit/${clientId}`, {
  params: { limit: 50 },
});
```

Each item in `data.items` contains the `action`, the `actor`, `changed_at`, and a `changes[]` array with `{ field, from, to }` entries — everything you need to render a timeline or diff view.

> **Participant events are on the campaign, not the participant.** When a client's status changes from TEST → LIVE, the audit event is stored under the campaign ID (not the client ID) with `action: "client_status_updated"`. To get the full participant history, query `GET /audit/{campaignId}`.

Query parameters: `limit` (default 50, max 500), `cursor`.

**POST `/audit/export`** — Body:

```json
{ "date": "2025-06-01" }
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "s3Key": "audit/2025/06/01/audit.ndjson",
    "count": 142
  }
}
```

### Usage examples

```typescript
// Change history for a single campaign (use this for a campaign changelog panel)
const campaignHistory = await api.get(`/audit/${campaignId}`, {
  params: { limit: 50 },
});

// Change history for a single lead (timeline panel)
const leadHistory = await api.get(`/audit/${leadId}`, {
  params: { limit: 50 },
});

// Activity feed — all changes to clients today
const today = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10);
const res = await api.get("/audit/activity", {
  params: { entity_type: "client", from: `${today}T00:00:00.000Z`, limit: 100 },
});
const { items, nextCursor } = res.data.data;

// Activity for a specific admin user (use their Cognito sub)
const adminActivity = await api.get("/audit/activity", {
  params: { actor_sub: "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890", limit: 50 },
});

// Paginate to the next page
if (nextCursor) {
  const nextPage = await api.get("/audit/activity", {
    params: { entity_type: "client", cursor: nextCursor },
  });
}
```

### User management audit trail

All Cognito user management operations (`POST /users`, `PUT /users/{id}`, `DELETE /users/{id}`, `PUT /users/{id}/enable`, `PUT /users/{id}/password`) are recorded with `entity_type: "user"`. The `entity_id` is the user's email address (also their Cognito username).

To view the full history for a specific user account:

```typescript
const encodedEmail = encodeURIComponent("jane@example.com");
const history = await api.get(`/audit/${encodedEmail}`);
```

Password reset events use `action: "password_reset"` with a redacted change record:

```json
{ "field": "password", "from": "[redacted]", "to": "[updated]" }
```

---

## Lead Delivery

Campaigns can automatically deliver accepted leads to buyer clients via webhook. The flow has three configuration layers:

1. **Per-client delivery config** — the webhook URL, HTTP method, field mappings, and acceptance rules.
2. **Per-campaign distribution config** — whether delivery is enabled and which mode to use (round-robin or weighted).
3. **Per-affiliate lead cap** — the maximum number of accepted leads an affiliate may send on a specific campaign.

### Set client delivery config

Before a client can be set to `LIVE`, a complete delivery config must be saved.

```
PUT /campaigns/{id}/clients/{clientId}/delivery
```

```typescript
await api.put(`/campaigns/${campaignId}/clients/${clientId}/delivery`, {
  url: "https://buyer.example.com/leads",
  method: "POST",
  // Optional: extra headers sent with every request
  headers: {
    "X-Api-Key": "secret123",
  },
  // Each entry maps one outbound payload key to a lead field or static value
  payload_mapping: [
    { key: "first_name", value_source: "field", field_name: "first_name" },
    { key: "phone", value_source: "field", field_name: "phone" },
    { key: "email", value_source: "field", field_name: "email" },
    // Static value — always sent as-is regardless of lead data
    { key: "source", value_source: "static", static_value: "smash-orbit" },
  ],
  // Rules are evaluated in order against the response body (case-insensitive substring match).
  // The first matching rule wins. If no rule matches, the lead is NOT sold.
  acceptance_rules: [
    { match_value: "accepted", action: "passed" },
    { match_value: "rejected", action: "failed" },
    { match_value: "duplicate", action: "failed" },
  ],
  // Optional: when true, a failed TrustedForm claim blocks delivery entirely for this client.
  // Default: false (claim failure is logged but delivery proceeds).
  // require_successful_claim: true,

  // Optional: relative weight for weighted distribution mode (positive integer, default 1).
  // Higher values = proportionally more leads routed to this client.
  // Only used when campaign distribution mode is "weighted".
  // weight: 3,
});
```

**Validation rules:**

- `url` must be a valid URL.
- `method` must be one of `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`.
- `payload_mapping` must have at least one entry. Entries with `value_source: "field"` must include a `field_name`.
- `acceptance_rules` must have at least one entry. Each rule needs a `match_value` and `action` of `passed` or `failed`.
- `claim_trusted_form` is not request input. Backend always persists it as `true`.
- `require_successful_claim` is optional (boolean). When `true`, a failed TrustedForm claim blocks delivery to this client. Defaults to non-blocking — delivery proceeds even if the claim fails.
- `weight` is optional (positive integer, default `1`). Sets this client's relative share of leads in `weighted` distribution mode. `weight: 3` on one client and `weight: 1` on another means the first receives 75% of leads. Ignored in `round_robin` mode.

Once a complete delivery config is saved, the client can be promoted to `LIVE` via `PUT /campaigns/{id}/clients/{clientId}`.

> **LIVE guard**: Attempting to set a client to `LIVE` without a complete delivery config returns a `400`-equivalent error explaining what is missing.

### Set distribution config

Enable (or disable) automatic lead distribution for the campaign entirely, and choose the distribution algorithm.

```
PUT /campaigns/{id}/distribution
```

```typescript
// Enable round-robin (each new lead goes to the next LIVE client in rotation)
await api.put(`/campaigns/${campaignId}/distribution`, {
  mode: "round_robin",
  enabled: true,
});

// Enable weighted (leads are distributed proportionally to each client's weight)
await api.put(`/campaigns/${campaignId}/distribution`, {
  mode: "weighted",
  enabled: true,
});

// Disable delivery entirely (leads are still accepted but not forwarded)
await api.put(`/campaigns/${campaignId}/distribution`, {
  mode: "round_robin",
  enabled: false,
});
```

| Mode          | Behaviour                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `round_robin` | Cycles through LIVE clients in order. Uses `rr_last_client_id` to track the cursor.              |
| `weighted`    | Selects the client that is furthest below its target share. Configure share via `client.weight`. |

### Set affiliate lead cap

Limit how many accepted leads an affiliate may send on a specific campaign.

```
PUT /campaigns/{id}/affiliates/{affiliateId}/cap
```

```typescript
// Set a cap of 500 leads
await api.put(`/campaigns/${campaignId}/affiliates/${affiliateId}/cap`, {
  lead_cap: 500,
});

// Remove the cap (no limit)
await api.put(`/campaigns/${campaignId}/affiliates/${affiliateId}/cap`, {
  lead_cap: null,
});
```

Once `leads_sent >= lead_cap`, subsequent live lead submissions from that affiliate are rejected with a `"Affiliate lead cap reached"` error. Test leads are never blocked by the cap.

Campaign responses now include backend-computed quota helpers per affiliate so frontend does not need to recalculate:

- `leads_sent`: running count of accepted live leads from this affiliate (defaults to `0`)
- `leads_remaining`: `lead_cap - leads_sent` (clamped to `0`), or `null` when uncapped
- `quota_completion_percent`: percent of cap used (`0..100`, 2 decimals), or `null` when uncapped

These fields are present on `GET /campaigns/{id}`, `GET /campaigns`, and campaign mutation responses that return campaign objects.

### Delivery outcome on the lead record

After delivery the lead record is updated with the following fields:

```typescript
interface LeadDeliveryResult {
  client_id: string; // ID of the client the lead was delivered to
  delivered_at: string; // ISO timestamp of the delivery attempt
  webhook_url: string; // Exact URL called
  webhook_method: string; // HTTP method (POST | GET | PUT | PATCH)
  webhook_response_status?: number; // HTTP status returned by the buyer
  webhook_response_body?: string; // First 4 KB of the response body
  accepted: boolean; // true if an acceptance_rule matched with action "passed"
  acceptance_match?: string; // The match_value that triggered the rule
  error?: string; // Set on network error or timeout (15 s)
  distribution_mode: "round_robin" | "weighted"; // Mode active when the lead was routed
  client_weight_at_delivery: number; // Client's weight at time of delivery (default 1)
}
```

On the lead object:

| Field                    | Type                                      | Description                                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `sold`                   | `boolean`                                 | `true` if the buyer accepted the lead              |
| `sold_status`            | `"sold" \| "not_sold" \| "not_delivered"` | Derived delivery status for UI rendering           |
| `sold_to_client_id`      | `string \| undefined`                     | ID of the client that purchased the lead           |
| `delivery_result`        | `LeadDeliveryResult \| undefined`         | Full delivery attempt details                      |
| `affiliate_pixel_result` | `AffiliatePixelResult \| undefined`       | Affiliate sold-pixel webhook dispatch telemetry    |
| `cherry_pickable`        | `boolean \| undefined`                    | Whether operator can cherry-pick this lead         |
| `cherry_picked`          | `boolean \| undefined`                    | Whether a cherry-pick has already been executed    |
| `cherry_pick_meta`       | `CherryPickMeta \| undefined`             | Cherry-pick execution metadata and delivery result |

`delivery_result.distribution_mode` and `delivery_result.client_weight_at_delivery` are always present on any delivery attempt. This allows historical fairness auditing even when weights or modes are later changed — the values at the time of routing are frozen into the lead record.

`affiliate_pixel_result` is written for sold leads after affiliate pixel dispatch is attempted. It includes: destination URL, final URL called, method, payload/query sent, response status/body, success flag, error (if any), and `fired_at`.

### Routing mode changes

When you switch distribution mode (e.g. `round_robin` → `weighted`) via `PUT /campaigns/{id}/distribution`, the change takes effect immediately on the next lead that arrives. All previously delivered leads retain their original `distribution_mode` in `delivery_result`. The `leads_delivered_count` counters on each client carry across mode changes, so the weighted algorithm starts from the accumulated real-world totals rather than resetting to zero.

### Audit events

Complete reference of all audit events written by the system. Every event is stored with `entity_id`, `entity_type`, `action`, `changes[]` (each entry `{ field, from, to }`), `actor`, and `changed_at`.

## Lead fields: `original_source` and `order_number`

Two new fields are now returned on every `Lead` object.

### `original_source` (string | null, immutable)

A verbatim copy of the raw `source` field captured at the moment the lead was ingested.

- Set once at intake from the incoming `source` form field.
- **Never overwritten** — even if the lead is edited later.
- `null` if the lead was created before this feature was shipped or if no `source` was provided.
- Useful for auditing the channel/traffic source regardless of downstream payload changes.

```json
{
  "id": "LD...",
  "original_source": "facebook_ads",
  "payload": {
    "source": "facebook_ads"
  }
}
```

### `order_number` (integer ≥ 1)

A normalized order-number field.

- Always an integer **≥ 1**. Null, 0, or non-numeric inputs from the inbound payload are coerced to `1` at ingestion.
- Reliable for display — never `null` or `0`.

---

## Criteria Catalog

The Criteria Catalog is a versioned library of **named criteria sets**. Instead of defining base criteria directly on each campaign, you can:

1. Create a named set in the catalog with a list of criteria fields.
2. Apply a specific version of that set to one or more campaigns.
3. Any update to the catalog set creates a new **immutable version** — existing campaign assignments are unaffected until you explicitly re-apply.

### Endpoints

#### List all catalog sets

```
GET /v2/campaigns/criteria-catalog
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "items": [
      /* CriteriaCatalogSet[] */
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Create a catalog set

```
POST /v2/campaigns/criteria-catalog
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Standard residential criteria",
  "description": "Used for all residential lead campaigns",
  "fields": [ /* optional initial field list — same shape as AddCriteriaFieldRequest */ ]
}
```

Creates both the set record and version 1 atomically. Returns the set + the initial version.

#### Get a catalog set with all versions

```
GET /v2/campaigns/criteria-catalog/{setId}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Returns `{ set: CriteriaCatalogSet, versions: CriteriaCatalogVersion[] }`.

#### Get a specific version

```
GET /v2/campaigns/criteria-catalog/{setId}/versions/{version}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Returns the `CriteriaCatalogVersion` object.

#### Update a catalog set (creates a new version)

```
PUT /v2/campaigns/criteria-catalog/{setId}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Updated name",          // optional
  "description": "New description", // optional
  "fields": [ /* full replacement field array — required */ ]
}
```

> `fields` is a **full replacement**. The existing `latest_version` is incremented and a new immutable `CriteriaCatalogVersion` is written. Campaigns that had previously applied an earlier version are **not** automatically updated.

#### Deactivate a catalog set

```
DELETE /v2/campaigns/criteria-catalog/{setId}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Sets `active = false`. Does not delete data or affect existing campaign assignments.

#### Apply a catalog version to a campaign

```
POST /v2/campaigns/{campaignId}/criteria/apply-catalog
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "criteria_set_id": "CCSA1B2C3D4",
  "version": 2
}
```

Copies all fields from the specified version snapshot into `campaign.base_criteria`. Sets `campaign.criteria_set_id` and `campaign.criteria_set_version` for traceability. The campaign ID is appended to `CriteriaCatalogVersion.campaigns_using`.

Response: the updated `Campaign` object.

## User Table Preferences

Per-user, per-table UI configuration. Lets each user persist their own column visibility, column ordering, sort preferences, and active filters for any data table in the frontend.

### Data model

**`TableConfig`** — the configuration object stored per table:

```ts
{
  columns?: TableColumnConfig[];  // column visibility + order
  sort?: TableSortConfig[];       // active sort state
  filters?: TableFilterConfig[];  // active filter state
}
```

**`TableColumnConfig`**:

| Field     | Type       | Notes                            |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `key`     | `string`   | Column identifier (e.g. `email`) |
| `visible` | `boolean`  |                                  |
| `order`   | `integer`  | 0-based render position          |
| `width`   | `integer?` | Width in pixels (optional)       |

**`TableSortConfig`**:

| Field       | Type              | Notes      |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| `field`     | `string`          | Column key |
| `direction` | `"asc" \| "desc"` |            |

**`TableFilterConfig`**:

| Field      | Type      | Notes                         |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| `field`    | `string`  | Column key                    |
| `value`    | any       | Filter value                  |
| `operator` | `string?` | E.g. `"contains"`, `"equals"` |

**`UserTablePreference`** — the stored record:

| Field        | Type          | Notes                                |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `user_id`    | `string`      | Cognito `sub` of the owning user     |
| `table_id`   | `string`      | Table identifier (e.g. `leads_view`) |
| `config`     | `TableConfig` |                                      |
| `updated_at` | ISO 8601      |                                      |
| `updated_by` | Actor         |                                      |

### `tableId` naming convention

Use a consistent identifier for each distinct UI table, e.g.:

| Table      | `tableId`         |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Leads list | `leads_view`      |
| Campaigns  | `campaigns_view`  |
| Clients    | `clients_view`    |
| Affiliates | `affiliates_view` |

You can use any string — the backend treats it as an opaque key.

### Endpoints

#### Get table preference

```
GET /v2/users/preferences/{tableId}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Returns the `UserTablePreference` for the calling user and the given `tableId`. Returns `404` if no preference has been saved yet (treat as "use defaults").

#### Save / update table preference

```
PUT /v2/users/preferences/{tableId}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "config": {
    "columns": [
      { "key": "email",      "visible": true,  "order": 0 },
      { "key": "first_name", "visible": true,  "order": 1 },
      { "key": "phone",      "visible": false, "order": 2 }
    ],
    "sort": [
      { "field": "created_at", "direction": "desc" }
    ],
    "filters": []
  }
}
```

Upsert — creates a new record or fully replaces the existing one. Returns the saved `UserTablePreference`.

#### Delete table preference

```
DELETE /v2/users/preferences/{tableId}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Removes the stored preference. The frontend should fall back to default column config after this.

### Audit trail

| `action`                   | `entity_type`           | When                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `table_preference_saved`   | `user_table_preference` | Preference created or updated |
| `table_preference_deleted` | `user_table_preference` | Preference deleted            |

### Recommended frontend pattern

```ts
// On table mount
async function loadPreferences(tableId: string) {
  try {
    const res = await api.get(`/v2/users/preferences/${tableId}`);
    applyConfig(res.data.config);
  } catch (e) {
    if (e.status === 404) applyDefaults(); // no preference saved yet
  }
}

// On column/sort/filter change (debounced)
async function savePreferences(tableId: string, config: TableConfig) {
  await api.put(`/v2/users/preferences/${tableId}`, { config });
}
```
